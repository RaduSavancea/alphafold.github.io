Hi, I’m Radu.

I’m an Artificial Intelligence Master’s student based in Stuttgart, Germany, looking forward to living in a world with more bits than atoms. I’m especially interested in deep learning and its applications to scientific problems and real-world challenges.

My first blog post explores the fundamental ideas behind AlphaFold.

This blog accompanies my deep learning seminar and documents my exploration of:

- Protein folding  
- Evolutionary constraints  
- Geometry-aware neural networks and their core principles  
- Biological Generative AI
